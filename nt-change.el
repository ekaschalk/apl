;; UNDER DEVELOPMENT

;; Support for buffer modifications, ie. text-editing.

;;; Code:
;;;; Requires

(require 'nt-base)

;;; Hook

(defun nt-change--after-change-function (start end chars-deleted)
  "See `after-change-functions', dispatches on insertion or deletion."
  (if (= 0 chars-deleted)
      (nt-change--insertion start end)
    (nt-change--deletion start chars-deleted)))

;;; Notes

;; ASSUMING BALANCED DELETION CURRENTLY
;; If I do end up needing a tree
;;  can recursively call the `nt-notes->roots' on each `-drop-while' section

;; A better version would trim-out every note in separate subtrees
;; but taking everything contained in the root is still far better than nothing
;; and likely to be close to optimized anyway in most situations

;; Further I can just store the roots and point to their children which
;; should be fine in most cases

;;; Utilities
