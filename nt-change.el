;;; Insertion

(defun nt-change--insertion-lines (start end count)
  "Change function specialized for insertions changing line-count."
  ;; This is a hard function, much harder than I originally expected.
  ;; Because insertion (both atm and on prev notes) need not be balanced.

  ;; STEPS
  ;; 1. Init a mask at each newline within start and end
  ;; 2. Check mask at line before START and mask after END
  ;;    call these mask-start and mask-end
  ;; 3a. If mask-start.notes == mask-end.notes := notes
  ;;     each new mask inherits notes
  ;;     THEN font-lock-mode /should/ handle any new notes within start and end
  ;; 3b. If mask-start.notes != mask-end.notes
  ;;     each new mask inherits mask-end.notes (I think??)

  ;; x. Get root containing point
  ;;    increment all bounds' ends of notes contained by root's line boundaries
  ;; x. Could also be completing a bound...
  ;;    first note backwards from start (might need extra conditions too)
  ;;    possibly update that notes bound
  ;;      if we do -> update all notes bounds contained within that notes root
  )

(defun nt-change--insertion-line-restricted (line)
  "Change function specialized for insertions of regions not crossing lines."
  ;; I /think/ it is this simple. Need to enumerate assumptions on this.

  ;; This relies on 'nt-bound not changing upon insertion of text in just line
  ;; Is this assumption valid?
  ;; It isn't valid if `sp-end-of-sexp' jumps to a different line.
  ;; Inserting a ")" maybe does it?

  ;; I think 'nt-bound's end could only ever decrease here.

  ;; What if: nt-bounds saves if the sexp isn't being completed
  ;; then this operates on notes backward from point up until root that
  ;; are being "completed" still
