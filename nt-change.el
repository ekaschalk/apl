;; UNDER DEVELOPMENT

;; Support for buffer modifications, ie. text-editing.

;;; Code:
;;;; Requires

(require 'nt-base)

;;; Hook

(defun nt-change--after-change-function (start end chars-deleted)
  "See `after-change-functions', dispatches on insertion or deletion."
  (if (= 0 chars-deleted)
      (nt-change--insertion start end)
    (nt-change--deletion start chars-deleted)))

;;; Notes

;; ASSUMING BALANCED DELETION CURRENTLY
;; If I do end up needing a tree
;;  can recursively call the `nt-notes->roots' on each `-drop-while' section

;; A better version would trim-out every note in separate subtrees
;; but taking everything contained in the root is still far better than nothing
;; and likely to be close to optimized anyway in most situations

;; Further I can just store the roots and point to their children which
;; should be fine in most cases

;;; Utilities

(defun nt-change--lines-deleted? ()
  "Have lines been deleted?"
  (let ((count (- (length nt-masks) (line-number-at-pos (point-max)))))
    (and (< 0 count) count)))

(defun nt-change--lines-added? ()
  "Have lines been deleted?"
  (let ((count (- (line-number-at-pos (point-max)) (length nt-masks))))
    (and (< 0 count) count)))

;;; Insertion

(defun nt-change--pos->outer-region (pos)
  "Get region of the outermost form's start/end containing POS."
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char pos)

    (let ((jumped?)
          (jumped-last?))
      (while (prog1 (setq jumped-last? (sp-up-sexp))
               (setq jumped? (or jumped? jumped-last?))))

      (when jumped?
        (let ((end (point)))
          (backward-sexp)
          (list (point) end))))))

(defun nt-change--region->outer-region (start end)
  "Get region of outermost forms containing START to containing END."
  (-let (((outer-start) (nt-change--pos->outer-region start))
         ((_ outer-end) (nt-change--pos->outer-region end)))
    (list (or outer-start start)
          (or outer-end end))))

;; XXX If this function is making things harder to reason about it can safely
;; be replaced (but will be potentially much slower) with:
;;   (nt-notes--update-bounded-buffer)
(defun nt-change--update-bounded-outer-region (start end)
  "Perform `nt-notes--update-bounded-region' on the maximal outer-region."
  (let ((outer-region (nt-change--region->outer-region start end)))
    (apply #'nt-notes--update-bounded-region outer-region)))

  "Change func specialized for insertion, in START and END."
  (let ((inhibit-modification-hooks t))

    ;; Build masks for the newlines if needed
    (-when-let (new-lines (nt-change--lines-added?))
      (let ((start-line (line-number-at-pos start))

    ;; Update all masks, possibly but not just including the above masks
    (nt-change--update-bounded-outer-region start end)))

;;; Deletion

(defun nt-change--deletion (pos chars-deleted)
  "Change function specialized for deletion, number CHARS-DELETED at POS.

Note that the 'modification-hook text property handles deletion of notes
and masks themselves."
  (when (nt-change--lines-deleted?)
