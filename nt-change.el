;;; Insertion

(defun nt-change--insertion-lines (start end count)
  "Change function specialized for insertions changing line-count."
  ;; This is a hard function, much harder than I originally expected.
  ;; Because insertion (both atm and on prev notes) need not be balanced.

  ;; STEPS
  ;; 1. Init a mask at each newline within start and end
  ;; 2. Check mask at line before START and mask after END
  ;;    call these mask-start and mask-end
  ;; 3a. If mask-start.notes == mask-end.notes := notes
  ;;     each new mask inherits notes
  ;;     THEN font-lock-mode /should/ handle any new notes within start and end
  ;; 3b. If mask-start.notes != mask-end.notes
  ;;     each new mask inherits mask-end.notes (I think??)

  ;; x. Get root containing point
  ;;    increment all bounds' ends of notes contained by root's line boundaries
  ;; x. Could also be completing a bound...
  ;;    first note backwards from start (might need extra conditions too)
  ;;    possibly update that notes bound
  ;;      if we do -> update all notes bounds contained within that notes root
  )

(defun nt-change--insertion (start end)
  "Change function specialized for insertion, in START and END."

  ;;        (start-line (- end-line new-lines))
  ;;        (line-before-change (1- start-line))

  ;;        ;; Must init masks ASAP for `nt-masks' integrity
