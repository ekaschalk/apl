;;; Insertion

(defun nt-change--insertion-lines (start end count)
  "Change function specialized for insertions changing line-count."
  ;; This is a hard function, much harder than I originally expected.
  ;; Because insertion (both atm and on prev notes) need not be balanced.

  ;; STEPS
  ;; 1. Init a mask at each newline within start and end
  ;; 2. Check mask at line before START and mask after END
  ;;    call these mask-start and mask-end
  ;; 3a. If mask-start.notes == mask-end.notes := notes
  ;;     each new mask inherits notes
  ;;     THEN font-lock-mode /should/ handle any new notes within start and end
  ;; 3b. If mask-start.notes != mask-end.notes
  ;;     each new mask inherits mask-end.notes (I think??)

  ;; x. Get root containing point
  ;;    increment all bounds' ends of notes contained by root's line boundaries
  ;; x. Could also be completing a bound...
  ;;    first note backwards from start (might need extra conditions too)
  ;;    possibly update that notes bound
  ;;      if we do -> update all notes bounds contained within that notes root
  )

(defun nt-change--insertion-line-restricted (start end)
  "Change function specialized for insertions of regions not crossing lines."
  ;; Possibly check note boundaries and extend if needed
  ;; Is region contained within any root, (so any notes applicable?)


  ;; for any (just first?) note on current line:
  ;; (new-bound (funcall (symbol-value #'nt-bound-fn) note))
  ;; (if new-bound != bound) => extend bound of notes contained by root
  ;; by the difference

  (let ((line (line-number-at-pos start))
        (bounds (nt-notes->maximal-bounds nt-notes)))
    (-when-let ((start-line end-line)
                (nt-bounds--contains? line bounds))
      (let ((notes (nt-notes<-lines start-line end-line)))

;;;; Deletion
