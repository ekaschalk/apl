;;; Commentary:

;; Collect pkg-wide imports and utils.

;; Members of this file are not required to be prefixed with `nt-base--' as other
;; files are (by convention).

;; Right now provides methods, macros, and others operating on LINES, REGIONS,
;; and POSITIONS.

;;; Code:
;;;; Requires

(require 'cl)

;;;;; Positions

;;;;; Columns

;;;;; Misc

(defun nt-line->idx (line)

;;;; Predicates

;;;; Macros
