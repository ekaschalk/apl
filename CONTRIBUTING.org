#+TITLE: Contributing to aplig


aplig needs and appreciates contributors!

This document will be fleshed out closer to a alpha/beta release.

* Issues
** Collecting Information

* Contributing Code
** Conventions

I politely ask several conventions to be followed of any PRs:

- Name your functions: ~aplig-[module-name](s)--my-func~
  - Eg. ~aplig-mask--init~ and ~aplig-masks--init~.

- Predicates should have ~?~ appended, not ~-p~.
  - Eg. ~aplig-ov--in-match?~ and ~aplig-mask--empty?~

- Functions should be organized into outlines (;;; comments) as best as
  possible.
  - Eg. ~;;; Predicates~ contains all predicates.

- Insert a form feed and newline before any top-level outline (3-asterisks).
  - Done via ~C-x 8 RET~ (~insert-char~) on ~FORM FEED~.

** Setup
** Test suite
