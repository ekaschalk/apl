#+TITLE: Contributing to aplig


aplig needs and appreciates contributors!

This document will be fleshed out closer to a alpha/beta release.

** Collecting Information

* Contributing Code
** Conventions

There are several conventions I'd like to maintain:

- Name your functions: ~aplig-[module-name](s)--my-func~
  - Eg. ~aplig-mask--init~ and ~aplig-masks--init~.

- Predicates should have ~?~ appended, not ~-p~.
  - Eg. ~aplig-ov--in-match?~ and ~aplig-mask--empty?~

- Functions should be organized into existing outlines (;;; comments) when
  reasonable.
  - Eg. ~;;; Predicates~ contains all predicates.

- Insert a form feed and newline before any top-level outline (3-asterisks), if
  your PR contains a new outline.
  - Done via ~C-x 8 RET~ (~insert-char~) and selecting ~FORM FEED~.
    - This is not a [[http:http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/modernization_formfeed.html][universal convention]]. However, combined with an outline
      (I markup with [[https://github.com/ekaschalk/.spacemacs.d/tree/master/layers/display/local/pretty-outlines][pretty-outlines]]), this is the best solution I've found to
      organizing and visually separating emacs-lisp code blocks.
