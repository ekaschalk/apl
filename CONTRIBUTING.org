#+TITLE: Contributing to Notate


Notate needs and appreciates contributors!

This document will be fleshed out closer to a alpha/beta release.

* Contributing
** Issues
** Code

There are several conventions I'd like to maintain, enumerated here.

- Use ~dash~ for list manipulation (eg. use ~-each~ over ~mapc~)
- Organize code in outlines (;;;-prefixed comments) when reasonable
- Name your functions: ~nt-[module](s)--my-func~
- Name your tests: ~[module]:[outline]:my-test~
