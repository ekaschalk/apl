#+TITLE: Contributing to Notate


Notate needs and appreciates contributors!

This document will be fleshed out closer to a alpha/beta release.

* Contributing
** Issues

There are several conventions I'd like to maintain, enumerated here.

- Name your functions: ~nt-[module](s)--my-func~
- Name your tests: ~[module]:[outline]:my-test~
- Use ~dash~ for list manipulation (eg. use ~-each~ over ~mapc~)
- Organize with outlines (;;; comments) when it is reasonable.
- If your PR contains a new outline, insert a form feed and newline before it.
  - Done via ~C-x 8 RET~ (~insert-char~) and selecting ~FORM FEED~.
    - This isn't [[http:http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/modernization_formfeed.html][universal]] but combined with marking up outlines like org does
      with [[https://github.com/ekaschalk/.spacemacs.d/tree/master/layers/display/local/pretty-outlines][pretty-outlines]], it helps me a lot in organizing my emacs-lisp code.
