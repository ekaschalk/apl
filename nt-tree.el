;;; Commentary:

;; Module will replace current `nt-tree.el' list-based note management with
;; `hierarchy' tree-based management.

;; See `nt-tree' for how the tree structure is defined.

;; See https://github.com/DamienCassou/hierarchy

;;; Code:
;;;; Requires

(require 'nt-base)

(require 'nt-bounds)
(require 'nt-mask)
(require 'nt-note)
(require 'nt-ov)

;;; Configuration
;;;; Managed

(defconst nt-tree (hierarchy-new)
  "Manage notes in a `hierarchy' tree based on interval-containment.

---

Roots are non-overlapping line-intervals with P-C relationship defined as:

  - A note n_c is a child of note n_p iff masks(n_p) contains masks(n_c).

  - If the masks are equal, then the first note by position is defined
    to be the parent.

---

Notes are sorted as follows:

  - n_1 < n_2 if n_1 is a child of n_2

  - otherwise, n_1 < n_2 if start(n_1) < start(n_2)

So the ordering looks like:

  - Sort roots by buffer position.

  - Insert before each root its children ordered by increasing size.")

;;; Aliases
