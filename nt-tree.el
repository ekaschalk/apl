;;; nt-tree.el --- Note Nodes -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright Â© 2019 Eric Kaschalk <ekaschalk@gmail.com>

;;; Commentary:

;; Module will replace current `nt-tree.el' list-based note management with
;; `hierarchy' tree-based management.

;; The intent that it will be easier and faster to write methods operating on
;; regions of batches of notes.

;; See https://github.com/DamienCassou/hierarchy

;;; Code:
;;;; Requires

(require 'nt-base)

(require 'nt-bounds)
(require 'nt-mask)
(require 'nt-note)
(require 'nt-ov)

;;; Configuration
;;;; Managed

(defconst nt-tree (hierarchy-new)
  "Manage NOTE nodes in a `hierarchy' tree.

Roots are non-overlapping line-intervals with P-C relationship defined as:
  A note n_c is a child of note n_p if masks(n_p) contains masks(n_c).

Notes are sorted as follows:
- n_1 < n_2 if n_1 is a child of n_2
- otherwise, n_1 < n_2 if start(n_1) < start(n_2)

So notes aren't line-ordered. Instead:
- Sort roots by buffer position.
- Insert before each root its children ordered by increasing size.")
