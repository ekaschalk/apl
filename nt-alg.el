;;; Commentary:

;; Unlike other modules that organize methods common in purpose or subject, this
;; module's membership is defined by complexity.

;; Code that isn't easy reading is quarantined here.

;;; Note Deletion
;;;; Commentary

;; Batch note deletion without recalculating bounds:

;; ROUGH DRAFT:

;; Given notes n_i ordered descending by indent, let m_i be the mask at line(n_i)
;; with the mask's notes denoted n_m_i.

;; Intersect n_m_0 with each n_m_1.. Add n_0 and call it note-chain C_0 maintaining order.
;; Repeat above for next note not contained in C_0 and call it C_1.
;; Repeat until each n_i is a member of some chain.

;; For each chain C_i, let l_i be the line of C_i[0] and then:
;; 1. Delete notes in C_i
;; 2. Goto line 1+l_i
;; 3. Remove any deleted notes from mask at line
;; 4. Forward-line and repeat step 3 until mask at line has no deleted notes

;;;; Implementation (Rough Draft)

;; None of below is tested yet not necessarily correct.
;; Starting point for figuring out batch deletion.

;; notes = n_i,         note = n_0
;; masks-notes = n_m_i, mask-notes = n_m_0
;; chains = C,          chain = C_0
