* APL - Always Program in Ligatures

(In-progress)

Indentation correcting visual replacements of symbols with other symbols.

Alignment and specifically indentation issues hamper generalized ligatures,
known as prettified-symbols in Emacs. APL attempts to bring the joy and
readability of APLang to every language!

** Goal

Centralize ligature/prettify/etc. packages under an optional, major-mode
agnostic indentation-aligning framework.
