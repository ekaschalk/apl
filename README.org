* Virtual Indent - Personalizing indentation

Exploring concept of "personalized indentation".

Several use-cases:

1. Rendering and editing a 2-indent python file as if it was a 4-indent, and the
   reverse.

2. Multi-character ligature replacements, like lambda -> lambda-symbol will not
   modify (ie. break) indentation in programming modes.

3. The `nameless-mode' library will not require a choice of which indentation to
   keep correct, your view or the true indent of the file.

Exciting stuff if an implementation can be successful.
