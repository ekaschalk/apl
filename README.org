* Virtual Indent - Personalized indentation

Exploring generalized concept of "personalized indentation": virtual-indent.

Several use-cases:
1. Rendering and editing a 2-indent python file as if it was a 4-indent, and the
   reverse.

2. Multi-character ligature replacements, like lambda -> lambda-symbol will not
   modify indentation in programming modes.

3. The `nameless-mode' library will not require a choice of which indentation to
   keep correct, the true or your view of the file.

Exciting stuff, and entirely unique to Emacs, if an implementation can be
successful.
