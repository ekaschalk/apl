;;; Commentary:

;; Calculate boundaries of notes effects on indentation masks. Major-mode
;; dependent functions are implemented here.

;;; Code:
;;;; Requires

(require 'nt-base)

(require 'nt-ov)

;;; Exposes

(defun nt-bound (note) (funcall (symbol-value #'nt-bound-fn) note))

;;; General
;;;; Bound-Based

;;;; Overlay-Based

;; sp-region-ok-p is a possibly very useful function

;;;; Predicates
;;;;; Conditions
