* Dash Tree Methods

(-tree-seq BRANCH CHILDREN TREE)

Return a sequence of the nodes in TREE, in depth-first search order.

BRANCH is a predicate of one argument that returns non-nil if the
passed argument is a branch, that is, a node that can have children.

CHILDREN is a function of one argument that returns the children
of the passed branch node.

Non-branch nodes are simply copied.

(-tree-map-nodes PRED FUN TREE)

Call FUN on each node of TREE that satisfies PRED.

If PRED returns nil, continue descending down this node.  If PRED
returns non-nil, apply FUN to this node and do not descend
further.
