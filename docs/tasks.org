Throwing todo comments in here.

Don't expect it to be kept up-to-date or organized at this point of time.

* TODOS

  - Think about making nt-bound-fn act on a region instead of a NOTE
  - Rename `nt-notes' to `nt-notes'

  (note decompose hook)
  ;; TODO Below will be replaced with the new deletion implementation that
  ;; doesn't require calling masks-for.


  Place this somewhere less prominent:
  ;; `hl-todo' users, remove highlighting of NOTE in docstrings with:
  ;;   (setq hl-todo-keyword-faces (--remove (s-equals? (car it) "NOTE") hl-todo-keyword-faces))
