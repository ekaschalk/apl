#+TITLE: aplig - Task Management

* Core
** TODO Buffer modifications

   Very involved task, still must determine all things to be accounted for.

* Nice to have
** TODO Retain up-down line movement's visual column

   When moving into an indentation-masked line, the visual column does not
   correspond to the true column, making vertical line movement also move
   left/right depending on whether we are ascending or descending a sexp.

   This isn't the end of the world but a substantial improvement should it be
   resolved.

** TODO Further test coverage

   This appears to be harder than expected to test modularly. Might need to
   invest in a more involved testing context macro.
